Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # linode_instance.terraform-web will be created
  + resource "linode_instance" "terraform-web" {
      + authorized_keys    = [
          + (sensitive value),

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
