# Linode Terraform provisioning training material

This is a simple cloud Linux environments (PaaS) scenario, where with time we'll be committing simple SREs environments provisioning scenario.

>Keeping in simple and clear is the motto here.

We want to leverage the best infrastructure as code design patterns and practices.
In bigger corporations, there still a lot to be made for implementing an SRE culture (as well as real agility), that will bridge the gap between software designers and system administrators.

Another goal would be to train the technical instructors, by catalyzing their understanding on the explored capabilities.
By scaffolding the standard provisioning scenarios we'll try to provide as much abstraction and ideas to help them master the exposed subjects, thus helping us grow this beautiful community.

Artificial intelligence (ChatGPT, Pilot) will also be explored with the goal to leveraged as much as possible business cases that should not require our involvement anymore.

>Time is the most precious thing we have and we should invest it perfecting our understanding and resolving as much problems for the sake of the following generations

AI generated code snippets will be tagged and our engagement with these platforms explained.

Since the wheel ws already invented, the rule of engagement is to integrate as much as possible the existing solutions.

The goal is to promote peace and solidarity so leveraging as much as possible open sourced framework will be the path to follow.

The training material promotes the positive embracement of technology and scaffolds the SDLC by leveraging as much as possible the CI/CD/SAST capabilities of Github SaaS.

> If by any chance it happened that you found this non marketed initiative, we'll be honored with your collaboration, sharing of ideas and best practices.
