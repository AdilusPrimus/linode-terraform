# Linode Terraform provisioning training material

This is a simple cloud Linux environments (PaaS) scenario, where with time we'll be comitting simple SREs environments provisonning scenario.

>Keeping in simple and clear is the motto here.

We want to leverage the best infrastructure as code design patterns and practises.
In bigger corporations, there still a lot to be made for implementing an SRE culture (as well as real agility), that will bridge the gap between softare designers and system administrators.

Another goal would be to train the technical instructors, by catalyzing their understaning on the explored capabilitie.
By scafoldding the standard proviinning scenarios we'll try toprovide as much abstraction and ideas to help them master the exposed subjets, thus helping us grow this beautiful community.

Artificial intelligence (ChatGPT, Pilote) will also be explored with the goal to leveraged as much as possible busines cases that should not require our involvement anymore.

>Time is the most precious thing we have and we should invest it perfeting our understanding and resolving as much problems for the sake of the following generations

AI generated snipets will be tagged and our engagement with these platforma explained.

Since the wheel ws already invented, the rule of engagement is to integrste as much as possible the existin solutions.

The goal is to promote peace and solidaity so leveraging as much as possible open sourced framework will be the path to follow.

The training material promotes the positive embracement of technology and scafolds the SDLC by leveraging as much as possible the CI/CD/SAST capabilities of Github SaaS.

> If by any chance it happened that you found this unmarketed initiative, we'll be honnored with your collaboration, sharing of ideas and best practises.
